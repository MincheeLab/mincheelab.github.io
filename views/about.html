     <p>A fab lab is a place for digital fabrication, prototyping, training and sharing.</p>
     
      A FabLab is a place for rapid prototyping that aims to be open, bringing together students, researchers, project leaders, employees from large corporations who wish to circumvent the obstacles inherent in large organisations and even enthusiasts from the general public. In these structures that have existed since 1991, we bring together talents to create value. What are Fab Labs? Fab Labs – digital fabrication laboratories – were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology. The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His idea was a simple one: to provide the environment, skills, advanced materials and technology to make things cheaply and quickly anywhere in the world, and to make this available on a local basis to entrepreneurs, students, artists, small businesses and, in fact, anyone who wants to create something new or bespoke.
